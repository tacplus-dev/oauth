# Proposals: oauth

Written by loopers. Each proposal: what, why, links. Jody promotes accepted ones into ROADMAP.md (via an agent);
the looper then marks it `promoted` or `declined` here with the date.

## Open
- **Authorize by stable provider key** (2026-10-27, #11): the sign-in state now names its provider by key, but
  `AuthorizeRequest.provider_index` is still the index ListProviders gave. If a tenant is deleted or edits its slice
  between the two calls, the index can name another provider, and the person is sent to that IdP (its allowlist
  still applies). Proposal: an additive `ProviderInfo.key` / `AuthorizeRequest.provider_key` in oauth.proto, which
  the webapp would send. That is a public contract change, so it is not made here.
- **ROADMAP.md "Now" line: tacplus floor 2.6, pinned 2.6.1** (2026-10-29, #13; 2026-11-07, #20, #21): the floor
  is 2.6 in tacplus.yaml, pinned to 2.6.1 and its build image by digest in tacplus.lock, but ROADMAP.md's "Now"
  line still says "Unreleased; tacplus floor 2.4" (v0.1.0 is tagged). #21 asks for that line to follow the floor;
  the looper may not change ROADMAP.md (its push is refused), so an agent changes it at Jody's request. Proposed:
  "Released v0.1.x (source tags); tacplus floor 2.6, pinned 2.6.1 in tacplus.lock."
- **ROADMAP.md "Later" line: #5's blockers** (2026-11-13, #25): "Release: tag from v0.1.0 and publish the image
  (#5; blocked on tacplus-dev/looper#12)" names a blocker closed 2026-10-29; #5 now waits on
  tacplus-dev/looper#115 and tacplus-dev/looper#112 (its `Blocked-by:` lines). #25 fixes the same line in
  STATE.md. Proposed: "(#5; blocked on tacplus-dev/looper#115 and tacplus-dev/looper#112)".
