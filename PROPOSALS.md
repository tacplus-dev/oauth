# Proposals: oauth

Written by loopers. Each proposal: what, why, links. Jody promotes accepted ones into ROADMAP.md (via an agent);
the looper then marks it `promoted` or `declined` here with the date.

## Open
- **Authorize by stable provider key** (2026-10-27, #11): the sign-in state now names its provider by key, but
  `AuthorizeRequest.provider_index` is still the index ListProviders gave. If a tenant is deleted or edits its slice
  between the two calls, the index can name another provider, and the person is sent to that IdP (its allowlist
  still applies). Proposal: an additive `ProviderInfo.key` / `AuthorizeRequest.provider_key` in oauth.proto, which
  the webapp would send. That is a public contract change, so it is not made here.

## Promoted / declined
